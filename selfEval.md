# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators? I feel confident with the basic comparison operators and what they mean
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators? I feel confident with the logical operators we have covered. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements? I feel somewhat confident. I can't identify when I make a mistake but the mistake makes sense once I am aware of it
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? I spent hours because I got stuck on one part and didn't even know how to ask an appropriate question to get un-stuck
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? I need to re-do this entire lesson and read additional notes on it to get more comfortable with the syntax. I will find time in my calendar to move these sections over
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? I still have questions about the sequence of events and will meet with a friend over zoom to review this process
